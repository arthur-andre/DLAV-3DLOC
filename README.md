# DLAV-3DLOC
Project on 3D vehicle localization for the course Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles. 


In this project, we aim to train a model to perform 3D car detection from RGB images. The ultimate goal is to integrate this module into other components in order to build an autonomous road planning algorithm.

## Contributions
From the paper "Delving into Localization Errors for Monocular 3D Object Detection,  after conducting diagnostic experiments, the research team deduced that the greatest potential for performance improvement lies in the fields of localization and 3d prediction. 

We wanted to continue in this direction, exploring several possibilities.
